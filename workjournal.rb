# Leaving for Granite Peak this morning!

# The tallest peak in Montana.

# I attempted it last year and failed miserably.

# Now I'm taking the lesson that I learned last year and bringing my brother and I think we have a great chance of success.

# Good luck to me! See you in three days :)


# Welp, we went.

# We had great success!

# It was so fun and a great experience to share with my brother.

# Posting on Instagram about it today and tomorrow.

# Heading up Black Mountian in the Absarokas this morning. Sunday Funday for yer boi, let's get it!

# Hollowtop tomorrow? Maybe Alex Lowe or Mt Bole. Or Emigrant in the Absaroka.

# Welp, did Hollowtop Mountain. It was definitely more fun than I expected. And very beautiful. Curry came with.

# Climbed the Sphinx today in the northern end of the southern Madisons. Excellent hike!

# Kinda sore today! Yesterday was 12 miles and 4,500' vertical. Not huge but pretty solid.

# Was supposed to climb this evening. Temps are too hot. Rescheduled for tomorrow morning.
