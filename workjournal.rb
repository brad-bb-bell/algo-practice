# Leaving for Granite Peak this morning!

# The tallest peak in Montana.

# I attempted it last year and failed miserably.

# Now I'm taking the lesson that I learned last year and bringing my brother and I think we have a great chance of success.

# Good luck to me! See you in three days :)


# Welp, we went.

# We had great success!

# It was so fun and a great experience to share with my brother.
